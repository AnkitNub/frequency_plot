## Deploy to Netlify

Want to deploy immediately? Click this button

[![Deploy to Netlify Button](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/netlify-templates/nextjs-toolbox)

Clicking this button will create a new repo for you that looks exactly like this one, and sets that repo up immediately for deployment on Netlify.

### Deploy using the Netlify CLI:
Click the 'Use the Template' button at the top of this repo or clone it with the `git clone` command. Then install the Netlify CLI tool and run `netlify init`. Or straight from the Netlify CLI, use the `netlify sites:create-template` command in you terminal ([learn more about this command here](https://www.netlify.com/blog/create-a-site-from-a-template-using-the-netlify-cli)) to do the entire flow for you.
